# Blitz - **supabase** Authentication Dev Log

***Date: 2024-10-04***

## Overview

We are initially implementing user authentication for our Blitz fantasy football app using **supabase** Auth. **supabase** provides a robust, flexible, and easy-to-implement authentication system that integrates seamlessly with its database features.

## Key Components

1. **Authentication Methods**
   - [x] Password-based login
   
> [!todo] 
> Implement the other auth flows

   - [ ] Magic link email
   - [ ] Social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter)
   - [ ] Phone authentication (SMS)

2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**
   - **supabase** uses JWTs for secure authentication
   - JWTs contain user information and are signed to ensure integrity

3. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Integrates with **supabase** database for fine-grained access control
   - Allows us to define who can read, create, update, or delete data

## Implementation Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created a new **supabase** project for Blitz
   - Obtained API keys and configuration details

2. **Client-Side Integration**
   - Installed **supabase** client library
   - Initialized **supabase** client with project URL and public API key

3. **User Registration**
   - Implemented sign-up functionality using `**supabase**.auth.signUp()`
   - Added form for email and password collection

4. **User Login**
   - Implemented sign-in functionality using `**supabase**.auth.signIn()`
   - Added support for password-based and magic link authentication

5. **Social Login Integration**
   - Configured Google authentication in **supabase** dashboard
   - Implemented "Sign in with Google" button using **supabase** API

6. **Session Management**
   - Utilized **supabase**'s session handling to maintain user state
   - Implemented logout functionality with `**supabase**.auth.signOut()`

7. **Protected Routes**
   - Created higher-order component to wrap protected routes
   - Checks for valid session before allowing access to certain pages

8. **User Profile**
   - Fetched user data using `**supabase**.auth.user()`
   - Implemented profile update functionality

## Database Integration

1. **User Table**
   - **supabase** automatically creates an `auth.users` table
   - Created a public `profiles` table to store additional user information

2. **Row Level Security**
   - Implemented RLS policies on the `profiles` table
   - Ensured users can only read/write their own profile data

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
   - Implemented proper password strength controls
   - Stored sensitive data securely using **supabase**'s built-in encryption

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for auth operations
   - Provided user-friendly error messages for common scenarios

3. **Testing**
   - Created unit tests for auth-related components and functions
   - Performed integration testing to ensure smooth auth flow

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Handling social login redirects in a mobile app environment.
   **Solution**: Implemented deep linking to handle OAuth redirects properly.

2. **Challenge**: Syncing user data between `auth.users` and our custom `profiles` table.
   **Solution**: Created a Postgres trigger to automatically create/update profile entries.

## Next Steps

1. Implement password reset functionality
2. Add more social login providers (e.g., Apple, GitHub)
3. Set up email templates for auth-related notifications
4. Implement role-based access control for admin features

This dev log provides a comprehensive overview of our **supabase** authentication implementation for the Blitz app. It covers the key components, implementation steps, best practices, and challenges we've encountered. As we continue to develop the app, we'll update this log with new insights and improvements to our authentication system.
