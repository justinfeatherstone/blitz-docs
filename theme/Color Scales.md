Thank you for providing that context, Justin. I understand now that Blitz is a fantasy football app and it's a personal project without a strict timeline. Given this information and the notes you've shared, let's flesh out your dev log a bit more:

# Blitz - Dev Log Entry

Date: 2024-10-04

## Project Overview
Blitz is a personal project aimed at creating a fantasy football app. The project involves developing a native app architecture and integrating real-time NFL statistics.

## Native App Architecture
- Currently working on the file structure for the native app
- Need to further define the components and their interactions

## API Integration
We're focusing on integrating real-time NFL statistics using the Tank01 API [1]. Key endpoints we're working with include:

1. In-Game Real Time NFL Statistics
2. Get Fantasy Point Projections
3. Get Player List
4. Get Player Information
5. Get General Game Information
6. Get NFL Games and Stats For a Single Player
7. Get NFL Team Roster
8. Get NFL Teams

The "Get NFL Teams" endpoint requires careful handling due to its extensive data return [2].

## Current Focus Areas
1. Setting up the basic app structure
2. Implementing API calls to fetch real-time NFL data
3. Designing the user interface for displaying fantasy football information

## Challenges and Considerations
1. Data Management: Handling large datasets returned by some API endpoints
2. Real-time Updates: Ensuring the app can handle frequent updates during live games
3. User Experience: Designing an intuitive interface for managing fantasy teams and viewing stats

## Next Steps
1. Complete the basic app structure
2. Implement and test API integrations
3. Begin work on the user interface design
4. Consider adding features like player comparisons or team analytics

## Notes
- Explored the ESPN Fantasy Football API (v3) but noted potential legal concerns [3]. Need to investigate further before considering integration.

This dev log provides a snapshot of your current progress on the Blitz fantasy football app. As you continue working on the project, you can update this log with specific achievements, challenges overcome, and new features implemented.

Is there anything specific you'd like to add or modify in this dev log?
